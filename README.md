# MemoPad

## Description

This application, called MemoPad, is designed for writing, saving, and managing notes efficiently. It uses an Express.js backend to store and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The front end of the application is already developed, and the task was to build the backend, connect it with the front end, and deploy the application to Heroku.
